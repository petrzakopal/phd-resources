# Research


## What I want to research

I have to decide, what topics should I get my hands on.

### Research Interrests

- electric drives
    - AC Induction
    - PMSM
    - BLDC
- controlling of electric drives - embedded systems
    - FPGA controlling systems - Designing Logical Circuits
        - Verilog (mainly), VHDL - need to learn syntax
    - CPU and micro controllers
        - C, C++
        - Rust want to check out for type and memory safety features
- using less power and financials demanding controllers which I want to test if they are production ready
    - OrangePi (CPU)
    - Lattice ICE40 Stick (FPGA)
    - Xilinx Kria KR260 (FPGA + CPU)
